      <P><SPAN class=answers>Server side scripting means that all the script 
      will be executed by the server and interpreted as needed. ASP doesn’t have 
      some of the functionality like sockets, uploading, etc. For these you have 
      to make a custom components usually in VB or VC++. Client side scripting 
      means that the script will be executed immediately in the browser such as 
      form field validation, clock, email validation, etc. Client side scripting 
      is usually done in VBScript or JavaScript. Download time, browser 
      compatibility, and visible code - since JavaScript and VBScript code is 
      included in the HTML page, then anyone can see the code by viewing the 
      page source. Also a possible security hazards for the client computer.

      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>What does the 
      "EnableViewState" property do? Why would I want it on or off? 
      </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>Enable ViewState turns on the 
      automatic state management feature that enables server controls to 
      re-populate their values on a round trip without requiring you to write 
      any code. This feature is not free however, since the state of a control 
      is passed to and from the server in a hidden form field. You should be 
      aware of when ViewState is helping you and when it is not. For example, if 
      you are binding a control to data on every round trip (as in the datagrid 
      example in tip #4), then you do not need the control to maintain it’s view 
      state, since you will wipe out any re-populated data in any case. 
      ViewState is enabled for all server controls by default. To disable it, 
      set the EnableViewState property of the control to false. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>What is the 
      difference between Server.Transfer and Response.Redirect? 
      </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>Why would I choose one over the 
      other? Server.Transfer() : client is shown as it is on the requesting page 
      only, but the all the content is of the requested page. Data can be 
      persist across the pages using Context.Item collection, which is one of 
      the best way to transfer data from one page to another keeping the page 
      state alive. Response.Dedirect() :client know the physical location (page 
      name and query string as well). Context.Items loses the persistence when 
      navigate to destination page. In earlier versions of IIS, if we wanted to 
      send a user to a new Web page, the only option we had was 
      Response.Redirect. While this method does accomplish our goal, it has 
      several important drawbacks. The biggest problem is that this method 
      causes each page to be treated as a separate transaction. Besides making 
      it difficult to maintain your transactional integrity, Response.Redirect 
      introduces some additional headaches. First, it prevents good 
      encapsulation of code. Second, you lose access to all of the properties in 
      the Request object. Sure, there are workarounds, but they’re difficult. 
      Finally, Response.Redirect necessitates a round trip to the client, which, 
      on high-volume sites, causes scalability problems. As you might suspect, 
      Server.Transfer fixes all of these problems. It does this by performing 
      the transfer on the server without requiring a roundtrip to the client. 
      </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>Can you give an 
      example of when it would be appropriate to use a web service as opposed to 
      a non-serviced .NET component? </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>When 
      to Use Web Services:<BR>* Communicating through a Firewall When building a 
      distributed application with 100s/1000s of users spread over multiple 
      locations, there is always the problem of communicating between client and 
      server because of firewalls and proxy servers. Exposing your middle tier 
      components as Web Services and invoking the directly from a Windows UI is 
      a very valid option.<BR><BR>* Application Integration When integrating 
      applications written in various languages and running on disparate 
      systems. Or even applications running on the same platform that have been 
      written by separate vendors.<BR><BR>* Business-to-Business Integration 
      This is an enabler for B2B integration which allows one to expose vital 
      business processes to authorized supplier and customers. An example would 
      be exposing electronic ordering and invoicing, allowing customers to send 
      you purchase orders and suppliers to send you invoices 
      electronically.<BR><BR>* Software Reuse This takes place at multiple 
      levels. Code Reuse at the Source code level or binary component-based 
      reuse. The limiting factor here is that you can reuse the code but not the 
      data behind it. Webservice overcome this limitation. A scenario could be 
      when you are building an app that aggregates the functionality of several 
      other Applications. Each of these functions could be performed by 
      individual apps, but there is value in perhaps combining the multiple apps 
      to present a unified view in a Portal or Intranet.<BR><BR>* When not to 
      use Web Services: Single machine Applications When the apps are running on 
      the same machine and need to communicate with each other use a native API. 
      You also have the options of using component technologies such as COM or 
      .NET Components as there is very little overhead.<BR><BR>* Homogeneous 
      Applications on a LAN If you have Win32 or Winforms apps that want to 
      communicate to their server counterpart. It is much more efficient to use 
      DCOM in the case of Win32 apps and .NET Remoting in the case of .NET 
      Apps.</SPAN></P>
