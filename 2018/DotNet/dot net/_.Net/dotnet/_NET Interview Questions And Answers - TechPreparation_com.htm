      <P><B><SPAN class=for_questions_blue>Advantages of migrating to VB.NET 
      ?</SPAN><SPAN class=answers><BR></SPAN></B><SPAN class=answers>Visual 
      Basic .NET has many new and improved language features — such as 
      inheritance, interfaces, and overloading that make it a powerful 
      object-oriented programming language. As a Visual Basic developer, you can 
      now create multithreaded, scalable applications using explicit 
      multithreading. Other new language features in Visual Basic .NET include 
      structured exception handling, custom attributes, and common language 
      specification (CLS) compliance. <BR><BR>The CLS is a set of rules that 
      standardizes such things as data types and how objects are exposed and 
      interoperate. Visual Basic .NET adds several features that take advantage 
      of the CLS. Any CLS-compliant language can use the classes, objects, and 
      components you create in Visual Basic .NET. And you, as a Visual Basic 
      user, can access classes, components, and objects from other CLS-compliant 
      programming languages without worrying about language-specific differences 
      such as data types. <BR><BR>CLS features used by Visual Basic .NET 
      programs include assemblies, namespaces, and attributes. <BR><BR>These are 
      the new features to be stated briefly:<BR>Inheritance<BR>Visual Basic .NET 
      supports inheritance by allowing you to define classes that serve as the 
      basis for derived classes. Derived classes inherit and can extend the 
      properties and methods of the base class. They can also override inherited 
      methods with new implementations. All classes created with Visual Basic 
      .NET are inheritable by default. Because the forms you design are really 
      classes, you can use inheritance to define new forms based on existing 
      ones. <BR><BR>Exception Handling<BR>Visual Basic .NET supports structured 
      exception handling, using an enhanced version of the Try...Catch...Finally 
      syntax supported by other languages such as C++. <BR><BR>Structured 
      exception handling combines a modern control structure (similar to Select 
      Case or While) with exceptions, protected blocks of code, and filters. 
      Structured exception handling makes it easy to create and maintain 
      programs with robust, comprehensive error handlers. 
      <BR><BR>Overloading<BR>Overloading is the ability to define properties, 
      methods, or procedures that have the same name but use different data 
      types. Overloaded procedures allow you to provide as many implementations 
      as necessary to handle different kinds of data, while giving the 
      appearance of a single, versatile procedure. Overriding Properties and 
      Methods The Overrides keyword allows derived objects to override 
      characteristics inherited from parent objects. Overridden members have the 
      same arguments as the members inherited from the base class, but different 
      implementations. A member's new implementation can call the original 
      implementation in the parent class by preceding the member name with 
      MyBase. <BR><BR>Constructors and Destructors<BR>Constructors are 
      procedures that control initialization of new instances of a class. 
      Conversely, destructors are methods that free system resources when a 
      class leaves scope or is set to Nothing. Visual Basic .NET supports 
      constructors and destructors using the Sub New and Sub Finalize 
      procedures. <BR><BR>Data Types<BR>Visual Basic .NET introduces three new 
      data types. The Char data type is an unsigned 16-bit quantity used to 
      store Unicode characters. It is equivalent to the .NET Framework System. 
      Char data type. The Short data type, a signed 16-bit integer, was named 
      Integer in earlier versions of Visual Basic. The Decimal data type is a 
      96-bit signed integer scaled by a variable power of 10. In earlier 
      versions of Visual Basic, it was available only within a Variant. 
      <BR><BR>Interfaces<BR>Interfaces describe the properties and methods of 
      classes, but unlike classes, do not provide implementations. The Interface 
      statement allows you to declare interfaces, while the Implements statement 
      lets you write code that puts the items described in the interface into 
      practice. <BR><BR>Delegates<BR>Delegates objects that can call the methods 
      of objects on your behalf are sometimes described as type-safe, 
      object-oriented function pointers. You can use delegates to let procedures 
      specify an event handler method that runs when an event occurs. You can 
      also use delegates with multithreaded applications. For details, see 
      Delegates and the AddressOf Operator. <BR><BR>Shared Members<BR>Shared 
      members are properties, procedures, and fields that are shared by all 
      instances of a class. Shared data members are useful when multiple objects 
      need to use information that is common to all. Shared class methods can be 
      used without first creating an object from a class. 
      <BR><BR>References<BR>References allow you to use objects defined in other 
      assemblies. In Visual Basic .NET, references point to assemblies instead 
      of type libraries. For details, see References and the Imports Statement. 
      Namespaces prevent naming conflicts by organizing classes, interfaces, and 
      methods into hierarchies. <BR><BR>Assemblies<BR>Assemblies replace and 
      extend the capabilities of type libraries by, describing all the required 
      files for a particular component or application. An assembly can contain 
      one or more namespaces. <BR><BR>Attributes<BR>Attributes enable you to 
      provide additional information about program elements. For example, you 
      can use an attribute to specify which methods in a class should be exposed 
      when the class is used as a XML Web service.</SPAN></P><!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="../_private/tbl_gglapck.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan -->

      <P class=answers>Multithreading<BR>Visual Basic .NET allows you to write 
      applications that can perform multiple tasks independently. A task that 
      has the potential of holding up other tasks can execute on a separate 
      thread, a process known as multithreading. By causing complicated tasks to 
      run on threads that are separate from your user interface, multithreading 
      makes your applications more responsive to user input.</P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>Using ActiveX Control in .Net </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>ActiveX control is a special type of COM component that 
      supports a User Interface. Using ActiveX Control in your .Net Project is 
      even easier than using COM component. They are bundled usually in .ocx 
      files. Again a proxy assembly is made by .Net utility AxImp.exe (which we 
      will see shortly) which your application (or client) uses as if it is a 
      .Net control or assembly. <BR><BR>Making Proxy Assembly For ActiveX 
      Control: First, a proxy assembly is made using AxImp.exe (acronym for 
      ActiveX Import) by writing following command on Command Prompt: 
      <BR><BR>C:&gt; AxImp C:MyProjectsMyControl.ocx<BR>This command will make 
      two dlls, e.g., in case of above command 
      <BR><BR>MyControl.dll<BR>AxMyControl.dll<BR>The first file MyControl.dll 
      is a .Net assembly proxy, which allows you to reference the ActiveX as if 
      it were non-graphical object. <BR><BR>The second file AxMyControl.dll is 
      the Windows Control, which allows u to use the graphical aspects of 
      activex control and use it in the Windows Form Project. <BR><BR>Adding 
      Reference of ActiveX Proxy Assembly in your Project Settings: To add a 
      reference of ActiveX Proxy Assembly in our Project, do this: <BR><BR>o 
      Select Project A Add Reference (Select Add Reference from Project 
      Menu).<BR>o This will show you a dialog box, select .Net tab from the top 
      of window.<BR>o Click Browse button on the top right of window.<BR>o 
      Select the dll file for your ActiveX Proxy Assembly (which is 
      MyControl.dll) and click OK o Your selected component is now shown in the 
      ‘Selected Component’ List Box. Click OK again Some More On Using COM or 
      ActiveX in .Net<BR><BR><BR>.Net only provides wrapper class or proxy 
      assembly (Runtime Callable Wrapper or RCW) for COM or activeX control. In 
      the background, it is actually delegating the tasks to the original COM, 
      so it does not convert your COM/activeX but just imports them. <BR><BR>A 
      good thing about .Net is that when it imports a component, it also imports 
      the components that are publically referenced by that component. So, if 
      your component, say MyDataAcsess.dll references ADODB.dll then .Net will 
      automatically import that COM component too! <BR><BR>The Visual Studio.NET 
      does surprise you in a great deal when u see that it is applying its 
      intellisense (showing methods, classes, interfaces, properties when 
      placing dot) even on your imported COM components!!!! Isn’t it a magic or 
      what? <BR><BR>When accessing thru RCW, .Net client has no knowledge that 
      it is using COM component, it is presented just as another C# assembly. 
      <BR><BR>U can also import COM component thru command prompt (for reference 
      see Professional C# by Wrox) <BR><BR>U can also use your .Net components 
      in COM, i.e., export your .net components (for reference see Professional 
      C# by Wrox)</SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>What is Machine.config? </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>Machine configuration file: The machine.config file 
      contains settings that apply to the entire computer. This file is located 
      in the %runtime install path%Config directory. There is only one 
      machine.config file on a computer. The Machine.Config file found in the 
      "CONFIG" subfolder of your .NET Framework install directory 
      (c:WINNTMicrosoft.NETFramework{Version Number} CONFIG on Windows 2000 
      installations). The machine.config, which can be found in the directory 
      $WINDIR$Microsoft.NETFrameworkv1.0.3705CONFIG, is an XML-formatted 
      configuration file that specifies configuration options for the machine. 
      This file contains, among many other XML elements, a browser Caps element. 
      Inside this element are a number of other elements that specify parse 
      rules for the various User-Agents, and what properties each of these 
      parsing supports. <BR><BR>For example, to determine what platform is used, 
      a filter element is used that specifies how to set the platform property 
      based on what platform name is found in the User-Agent string. 
      Specifically, the machine.config file contains: 
      <BR><BR>platform=Win95<BR>platform=Win98<BR>platform=WinNT<BR>...<BR><BR><BR>That 
      is, if in the User-Agent string the string "Windows 95" or "Win95" is 
      found, the platform property is set to Win95. There are a number of filter 
      elements in the browserCaps element in the machine.config file that define 
      the various properties for various User-Agent strings. <BR><BR>Hence, when 
      using the Request.Browser property to determine a user's browser features, 
      the user's agent string is matched up to particular properties in the 
      machine.config file. The ability for being able to detect a user's 
      browser's capabilities, then, is based upon the honesty in the browser's 
      sent User-Agent string. For example, Opera can be easily configured to 
      send a User-Agent string that makes it appear as if it's IE 5.5. In this 
      case from the Web server's perspective (and, hence, from your ASP.NET Web 
      page's perspective), the user is visiting using IE 5.5, even though, in 
      actuality, he is using Opera. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>What is Web.config? </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>In classic ASP all Web site related information was 
      stored in the metadata of IIS. This had the disadvantage that remote Web 
      developers couldn't easily make Web-site configuration changes. For 
      example, if you want to add a custom 404 error page, a setting needs to be 
      made through the IIS admin tool, and you're Web host will likely charge 
      you a flat fee to do this for you. With ASP.NET, however, these settings 
      are moved into an XML-formatted text file (Web.config) that resides in the 
      Web site's root directory. Through Web.config you can specify settings 
      like custom 404 error pages, authentication and authorization settings for 
      the Web sitempilation options for the ASP.NET Web pages, if tracing should 
      be enabled, etc.<BR>The Web.config file is an XML-formatted file. At the 
      root level is the tag. Inside this tag you can add a number of other tags, 
      the most common and useful one being the system.web tag, where you will 
      specify most of the Web site configuration parameters. However, to specify 
      application-wide settings you use the tag. <BR><BR>For example, if we 
      wanted to add a database connection string parameter we could have a 
      Web.config file like so. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>What is the difference between ADO and 
      ADO.NET? </B><SPAN class=answers><BR>ADO uses Recordsets and cursors to 
      access and modify data. Because of its inherent design, Recordset can 
      impact performance on the server side by tying up valuable resources. In 
      addition, COM marshalling - an expensive data conversion process - is 
      needed to transmit a Recordset. ADO.NET addresses three important needs 
      that ADO doesn't address: <BR><BR>1. Providing a comprehensive 
      disconnected data-access model, which is crucial to the Web 
      environment<BR>2. Providing tight integration with XML, and<BR>3. 
      Providing seamless integration with the .NET Framework (e.g., 
      compatibility with the base class library's type system). From an ADO.NET 
      implementation perspective, the Recordset object in ADO is eliminated in 
      the .NET architecture. In its place, ADO.NET has several dedicated objects 
      led by the DataSet object and including the DataAdapter, and DataReader 
      objects to perform specific tasks. In addition, ADO.NET DataSets operate 
      in disconnected state whereas the ADO RecordSet objects operated in a 
      fully connected state.<BR><BR>In ADO, the in-memory representation of data 
      is the RecordSet. In ADO.NET, it is the dataset. A RecordSet looks like a 
      single table. If a RecordSet is to contain data from multiple database 
      tables, it must use a JOIN query, which assembles the data from the 
      various database tables into a single result table. In contrast, a dataset 
      is a collection of one or more tables. The tables within a dataset are 
      called data tables; specifically, they are DataTable objects. If a dataset 
      contains data from multiple database tables, it will typically contain 
      multiple DataTable objects. That is, each DataTable object typically 
      corresponds to a single database table or view. In this way, a dataset can 
      mimic the structure of the underlying database. <BR><BR>In ADO you scan 
      sequentially through the rows of the RecordSet using the ADO MoveNext 
      method. In ADO.NET, rows are represented as collections, so you can loop 
      through a table as you would through any collection, or access particular 
      rows via ordinal or primary key index. A cursor is a database element that 
      controls record navigation, the ability to update data, and the visibility 
      of changes made to the database by other users. ADO.NET does not have an 
      inherent cursor object, but instead includes data classes that provide the 
      functionality of a traditional cursor. For example, the functionality of a 
      forward-only, read-only cursor is available in the ADO.NET DataReader 
      object. <BR><BR>There is one significant difference between disconnected 
      processing in ADO and ADO.NET. In ADO you communicate with the database by 
      making calls to an OLE DB provider. In ADO.NET you communicate with the 
      database through a data adapter (an OleDbDataAdapter, SqlDataAdapter, 
      OdbcDataAdapter, or OracleDataAdapter object), which makes calls to an OLE 
      DB provider or the APIs provided by the underlying data 
      source.</SPAN></P><SPAN class=bottom_links><SPAN class=answers>Page
