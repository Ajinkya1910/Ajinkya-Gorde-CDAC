      <P><FONT class=for_questions_blue color=#ff0000><U><B>Can you explain the 
      difference between an ADO.NET Dataset and an ADO Recordset?<SPAN 
      class=answers><BR></SPAN></B></U></FONT><SPAN class=answers>In ADO, the 
      in-memory representation of data is the RecordSet. In ADO.NET, it is the 
      dataset. There are important differences between them.<BR><BR>* A 
      RecordSet looks like a single table. If a recordset is to contain data 
      from multiple database tables, it must use a JOIN query, which assembles 
      the data from the various database tables into a single result table. In 
      contrast, a dataset is a collection of one or more tables. The tables 
      within a dataset are called data tables; specifically, they are DataTable 
      objects. If a dataset contains data from multiple database tables, it will 
      typically contain multiple DataTable objects. That is, each DataTable 
      object typically corresponds to a single database table or view. In this 
      way, a dataset can mimic the structure of the underlying database. A 
      dataset usually also contains relationships. A relationship within a 
      dataset is analogous to a foreign-key relationship in a database —that is, 
      it associates rows of the tables with each other. For example, if a 
      dataset contains a table about investors and another table about each 
      investor’s stock purchases, it could also contain a relationship 
      connecting each row of the investor table with the corresponding rows of 
      the purchase table. Because the dataset can hold multiple, separate tables 
      and maintain information about relationships between them, it can hold 
      much richer data structures than a recordset, including self-relating 
      tables and tables with many-to-many relationships.<BR><BR>* In ADO you 
      scan sequentially through the rows of the recordset using the ADO MoveNext 
      method. In ADO.NET, rows are represented as collections, so you can loop 
      through a table as you would through any collection, or access particular 
      rows via ordinal or primary key index. DataRelation objects maintain 
      information about master and detail records and provide a method that 
      allows you to get records related to the one you are working with. For 
      example, starting from the row of the Investor table for "Nate Sun," you 
      can navigate to the set of rows of the Purchase table describing his 
      purchases. A cursor is a database element that controls record navigation, 
      the ability to update data, and the visibility of changes made to the 
      database by other users. ADO.NET does not have an inherent cursor object, 
      but instead includes data classes that provide the functionality of a 
      traditional cursor. For example, the functionality of a forward-only, 
      read-only cursor is available in the ADO.NET DataReader object. For more 
      information about cursor functionality, see Data Access 
      Technologies.<BR><BR>* Minimized Open Connections: In ADO.NET you open 
      connections only long enough to perform a database operation, such as a 
      Select or Update. You can read rows into a dataset and then work with them 
      without staying connected to the data source. In ADO the recordset can 
      provide disconnected access, but ADO is designed primarily for connected 
      access. There is one significant difference between disconnected 
      processing in ADO and ADO.NET. In ADO you communicate with the database by 
      making calls to an OLE DB provider. In ADO.NET you communicate with the 
      database through a data adapter (an OleDbDataAdapter, SqlDataAdapter, 
      OdbcDataAdapter, or OracleDataAdapter object), which makes calls to an OLE 
      DB provider or the APIs provided by the underlying data source. The 
      important difference is that in ADO.NET the data adapter allows you to 
      control how the changes to the dataset are transmitted to the database — 
      by optimizing for performance, performing data validation checks, or 
      adding any other extra processing. Data adapters, data connections, data 
      commands, and data readers are the components that make up a .NET 
      Framework data provider. Microsoft and third-party providers can make 
      available other .NET Framework data providers that can be integrated into 
      Visual Studio.<BR><BR>* Sharing Data Between Applications. Transmitting an 
      ADO.NET dataset between applications is much easier than transmitting an 
      ADO disconnected recordset. To transmit an ADO disconnected recordset from 
      one component to another, you use COM marshalling. To transmit data in 
      ADO.NET, you use a dataset, which can transmit an XML stream.<BR><BR>* 
      Richer data types.COM marshalling provides a limited set of data types — 
      those defined by the COM standard. Because the transmission of datasets in 
      ADO.NET is based on an XML format, there is no restriction on data types. 
      Thus, the components sharing the dataset can use whatever rich set of data 
      types they would ordinarily use.<BR><BR>* Performance. Transmitting a 
      large ADO recordset or a large ADO.NET dataset can consume network 
      resources; as the amount of data grows, the stress placed on the network 
      also rises. Both ADO and ADO.NET let you minimize which data is 
      transmitted. But ADO.NET offers another performance advantage, in that 
      ADO.NET does not require data-type conversions. ADO, which requires COM 
      marshalling to transmit records sets among components, does require that 
      ADO data types be converted to COM data types.<BR><BR>* Penetrating 
      Firewalls.A firewall can interfere with two components trying to transmit 
      disconnected ADO recordsets. Remember, firewalls are typically configured 
      to allow HTML text to pass, but to prevent system-level requests (such as 
      COM marshalling) from passing.</SPAN></P>

      guaranteed to occur only once throughout the lifetime of the application. 
      It’s a good place to initialize global variables. For example, you might 
      want to retrieve a list of products from a database table and place the 
      list in application state or the Cache object. SessionStateModule exposes 
      both Session_Start and Session_End events. <BR><BR>If I’m developing an

      <P><SPAN class=answers>Web Forms are the heart and soul of ASP.NET. Web 
      Forms are the User Interface (UI) elements that give your Web applications 
      their look and feel. Web Forms are similar to Windows Forms in that they 
      provide properties, methods, and events for the controls that are placed 
      onto them. However, these UI elements render themselves in the appropriate 
      markup language required by the request, e.g. HTML. If you use Microsoft 
      Visual Studio .NET, you will also get the familiar drag-and-drop interface 
      used to create your UI for your Web application. </SPAN><BR></P>

      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><U>Can you explain what inheritance is and 
      an example of when you might use it? </U></B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>Inheritance is a fundamental feature of an object 
      oriented system and it is simply the ability to inherit data and 
      functionality from a parent object. Rather than developing new objects 
      from scratch, new code can be based on the work of other programmers, 
      adding only new features that are needed. </SPAN><BR></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><U>How would you implement inheritance 
      using VB.NET/C#? </U></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>When we set out to 
      implement a class using inheritance, we must first start with an existing 
      class from which we will derive our new subclass. This existing class, or 
      base class, may be part of the .NET system class library framework, it may 
      be part of some other application or .NET assembly, or we may create it as 
      part of our existing application. Once we have a base class, we can then 
      implement one or more subclasses based on that base class. Each of our 
      subclasses will automatically have all of the methods, properties, and 
      events of that base class ? including the implementation behind each 
      method, property, and event. Our subclass can add new methods, properties, 
      and events of its own - extending the original interface with new 
      functionality. Additionally, a subclass can replace the methods and 
      properties of the base class with its own new implementation - effectively 
      overriding the original behavior and replacing it with new behaviors. 
      Essentially inheritance is a way of merging functionality from an existing 
      class into our new subclass. Inheritance also defines rules for how these 
      methods, properties, and events can be merged. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><U>What's an assembly?</U> </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>Assemblies are the building blocks of .NET Framework 
      applications; they form the fundamental unit of deployment, version 
      control, reuse, activation scoping, and security permissions. An assembly 
      is a collection of types and resources that are built to work together and 
      form a logical unit of functionality. An assembly provides the common 
      language runtime with the information it needs to be aware of type 
      implementations. To the runtime, a type does not exist outside the context 
      of an assembly. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><U>Describe the difference between inline 
      and code behind - which is best in a loosely coupled solution? 
      </U></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>ASP.NET supports two modes of page 
      development: Page logic code that is written inside &lt;script 
      runat=server&gt; blocks within an .aspx file and dynamically compiled the 
      first time the page is requested on the server. Page logic code that is 
      written within an external class that is compiled prior to deployment on a 
      server and linked "behind" the .aspx file at run time.</SPAN> </P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><U>Explain what a diffgram is, and a good 
      use for one? </U></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>A DiffGram is an XML format 
      that is used to identify current and original versions of data elements. 
      The DataSet uses the DiffGram format to load and persist its contents, and 
      to serialize its contents for transport across a network connection. When 
      a DataSet is written as a DiffGram, it populates the DiffGram with all the 
      necessary information to accurately recreate the contents, though not the 
      schema, of the DataSet, including column values from both the Original and 
      Current row versions, row error information, and row order. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><U>Where would you use an iHTTPModule, and 
      what are the limitations of anyapproach you might take in implementing 
      one? </U></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>One of ASP.NET’s most useful features 
      is the extensibility of the HTTP pipeline, the path that data takes 
      between client and server. You can use them to extend your ASP.NET 
      applications by adding pre- and post-processing to each HTTP request 
      coming into your application. For example, if you wanted custom 
      authentication facilities for your application, the best technique would 
      be to intercept the request when it comes in and process the request in a 
      custom HTTP module. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><U>In what order do the events of an ASPX 
      page execute. As a developer is it important to understand these events? 
      </U></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>Every Page object (which your .aspx page 
      is) has nine events, most of which you will not have to worry about in
