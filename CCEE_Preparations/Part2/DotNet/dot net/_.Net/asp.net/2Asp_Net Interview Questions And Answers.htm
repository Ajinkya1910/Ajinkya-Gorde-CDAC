      <P><B><FONT color=#0000ff><U><SPAN class=for_questions_blue>What is the 
      transport protocol you use to call a Web service?</SPAN><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR></SPAN></U></FONT></B><SPAN 
      class=answers>Answer1:<BR>SOAP. Transport Protocols: It is essential for 
      the acceptance of Web Services that they are based on established Internet 
      infrastructure. This in fact imposes the usage of of the HTTP, SMTP and 
      FTP protocols based on the TCP/IP family of transports. Messaging 
      Protocol: The format of messages exchanged between Web Services clients 
      and Web Services should be vendor neutral and should not carry details 
      about the technology used to implement the service. Also, the message 
      format should allow for extensions and different bindings to specific 
      transport protocols. SOAP and ebXML Transport are specifications which 
      fulfill these requirements. We expect that the W3C XML Protocol Working 
      Group defines a successor standard. <BR><BR>Answer2:<BR>SOAP is not the 
      transport protocol. SOAP is the data encapsulation protocol that is used 
      but the transport protocol is fairly unlimited. Generally HTTP is the most 
      common transport protocol used though you could conceivanly use things 
      like SMTP or any others. SOAP is not dependant on any single transport 
      protocol or OS, it is a syntactical and logical definition, not a 
      transport protocol. </SPAN></P>

      make sure your objects are serializable.<BR>- For session state to be 
      maintained across different web servers in the web farm, the Application 
      Path of the website in the IIS Metabase should be identical in all the web 
      servers in the web farm.</SPAN> <BR></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>What are the 
      disadvantages of viewstate/what are the benefits? </U></FONT></B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>Answer1:<BR>Disadvantage of viewstate is that additional 
      data is sent to the browser. The benefits are that you do not have to 
      manually manage refreshing the page fields after a submit, (when 
      re-displaying the same page). <BR><BR>Answer2:<BR>Automatic view-state 
      management is a feature of server controls that enables them to repopulate 
      their property values on a round trip (without you having to write any 
      code). This feature does impact performance, however, since a server 
      control’s view state is passed to and from the server in a hidden form 
      field. You should be aware of when view state helps you and when it 
      hinders your page’s performance. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>What tags do you 
      need to add within the asp:datagrid tags to bind columns manually? 
      </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>Answer1:<BR>Set AutoGenerateColumns 
      Property to false on the datagrid tag <BR><BR>Answer2:<BR>tag and either 
      or tags (with appropriate attributes of course) </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>What is State 
      Management in .Net and how many ways are there to maintain a state in 
      .Net? What is view state? </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>Web pages 
      are recreated each time the page is posted to the server. In traditional 
      Web programming, this would ordinarily mean that all information 
      associated with the page and the controls on the page would be lost with 
      each round trip.<BR>To overcome this inherent limitation of traditional 
      Web programming, the ASP.NET page framework includes various options to 
      help you preserve changes — that is, for managing state. The page 
      framework includes a facility called view state that automatically 
      preserves property values of the page and all the controls on it between 
      round trips.<BR>However, you will probably also have application-specific 
      values that you want to preserve. To do so, you can use one of the state 
      management options.<BR>Client-Based State Management Options:<BR>View 
      State<BR>Hidden Form Fields<BR>Cookies<BR>Query Strings<BR>Server-Based 
      State Management Options<BR>Application State<BR>Session State<BR>Database 
      Support</SPAN></P>

      interpretation of the quesiton, but I think you were aiming for SOAP (with 
      the caveat that this is MS’s version of SOAP) </SPAN><BR></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>What is the 
      difference between boxing and unboxing ? </U></FONT></B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>Boxing allows us to convert value types to reference 
      types. Basically, the runtime creates a temporary reference-type box for 
      the object on heap.<BR>Eg:<BR>int i=20;<BR>object o=i; </SPAN><BR></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>Describe the 
      difference between a Thread and a Process? </U></FONT></B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>Answer1:<BR>Thread - is used to execute more than one 
      program at a time. <BR>process - executes single program 
      <BR><BR>Answer2:<BR>A thread is a path of execution that run on CPU, a 
      proccess is a collection of threads that share the same virtual memory. A 
      process have at least one thread of execution, and a thread always run in 
      a process context. <BR><BR>Answer3:<BR>The operating system creates a 
      process for the purpose of running a program. Each process executes a 
      single program. Processes own resources allocated by the operating system. 
      Resources include memory, file handles, sockets, device handles, and 
      windows. Processes do not share address spaces or file resources except 
      through explicit methods such as inheriting file handles or shared memory 
      segments, or mapping the same file in a shared way. <BR>Threads allow a 
      program to do multiple things concurrently. At least one thread exists 
      within each process. If multiple threads can exist within a process, then 
      they share the same memory and file resources. <BR><BR>Answer4:<BR>Thread 
      is a light weight process, which is initialized itself by a process. Light 
      weigt processes does not loads resources required by it itself, these are 
      loaded by its parent process which has generated it. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>What is a Windows 
      Service and how does its lifecycle differ from a “standard” EXE? 
      </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>Windows Service applications are 
      long-running applications that are ideal for use in server environments. 
      The applications do not have a user interface or produce any visual 
      output; it is instead used by other programs or the system to perform 
      operations. Any user messages are typically written to the Windows Event 
      Log. Services can be automatically started when the computer is booted. 
      This makes services ideal for use on a server or whenever you need 
      long-running functionality that does not interfere with other users who 
      are working on the same computer. They do not require a logged in user in 
      order to execute and can run under the context of any user including the 
      system. Windows Services are controlled through the Service Control 
      Manager where they can be stopped, paused, and started as 
      needed.</SPAN></P>
