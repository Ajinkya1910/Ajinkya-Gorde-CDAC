      class=answers>.NET is essentially a framework for software development. It 
      is similar in nature to any other software development framework (J2EE 
      etc) in that it provides a set of runtime containers/capabilities, and a 
      rich set of pre-built functionality in the form of class libraries and 
      APIs <BR>The .NET Framework is an environment for building, deploying, and 
      running Web Services and other applications. It consists of three main 
      parts: the Common Language Runtime, the Framework classes, and ASP.NET. 
      </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>How many languages 
      .NET is supporting now? </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>When .NET 
      was introduced it came with several languages. VB.NET, C#, COBOL and Perl, 
      etc. The site DotNetLanguages.Net says 44 languages are supported. 
      </SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=for_questions_blue><B><FONT color=#0000ff><U>How is .NET 
      able to support multiple languages?</U></FONT></B></SPAN> <SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>A language should comply with the Common Language 
      Runtime standard to become a .NET language. In .NET, code is compiled to 
      Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL for short). This is called as 
      Managed Code. This Managed code is run in .NET environment. So after 
      compilation to this IL the language is not a barrier. A code can call or 
      use a function written in another language. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>How ASP .NET 
      different from ASP? </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>Scripting is

      itself automatically. How? The values are encrypted and saved in hidden 
      controls. this is done automatically by the ASP.NET. This can be switched

      <P><B class=for_questions_blue><FONT color=#0000ff><U>Observations between 
      VB.NET and VC#.NET? </U></FONT></B><SPAN class=answers><BR>Choosing a 
      programming language depends on your language experience and the scope of 
      the application you are building. While small applications are often 
      created using only one language, it is not uncommon to develop large 
      applications using multiple languages. <BR><BR>For example, if you are 
      extending an application with existing XML Web services, you might use a 
      scripting language with little or no programming effort. For client-server 
      applications, you would probably choose the single language you are most 
      comfortable with for the entire application. For new enterprise 
      applications, where large teams of developers create components and 
      services for deployment across multiple remote sites, the best choice 
      might be to use several languages depending on developer skills and 
      long-term maintenance expectations. <BR><BR>The .NET Platform programming 
      languages - including Visual Basic .NET, Visual C#, and Visual C++ with 
      managed extensions, and many other programming languages from various 
      vendors - use .NET Framework services and features through a common set of 
      unified classes. The .NET unified classes provide a consistent method of 
      accessing the platform's functionality. If you learn to use the class 
      library, you will find that all tasks follow the same uniform 
      architecture. You no longer need to learn and master different API 
      architectures to write your applications. <BR><BR>In most situations, you 
      can effectively use all of the Microsoft programming languages. 
      Nevertheless, each programming language has its relative strengths and you 
      will want to understand the features unique to each language. The 
      following sections will help you choose the right programming language for 
      your application. <BR><BR>Visual Basic .NET<BR>Visual Basic .NET is the 
      next generation of the Visual Basic language from Microsoft. With Visual 
      Basic you can build .NET applications, including Web services and ASP.NET 
      Web applications, quickly and easily. Applications made with Visual Basic 
      are built on the services of the common language runtime and take 
      advantage of the .NET Framework. <BR><BR>Visual Basic has many new and 
      improved features such as inheritance, interfaces, and overloading that 
      make it a powerful object-oriented programming language. Other new 
      language features include free threading and structured exception 
      handling. Visual Basic fully integrates the .NET Framework and the common 
      language runtime, which together provide language interoperability, 
      garbage collection, enhanced security, and improved versioning support. A 
      Visual Basic support single inheritance and creates Microsoft intermediate 
      language (MSIL) as input to native code compilers. <BR><BR>Visual Basic is 
      comparatively easy to learn and use, and Visual Basic has become the 
      programming language of choice for hundreds of thousands of developers 
      over the past decade. An understanding of Visual Basic can be leveraged in 
      a variety of ways, such as writing macros in Visual Studio and providing 
      programmability in applications such as Microsoft Excel, Access, and Word. 
      <BR><BR>Visual Basic provides prototypes of some common project types, 
      including:<BR>• Windows Application.<BR>• Class Library.<BR>• Windows 
      Control Library.<BR>• ASP.NET Web Application.<BR>• ASP.NET Web 
      Service.<BR>• Web Control Library.<BR>• Console Application.<BR>• Windows 
      Service.<BR>• Windows Service.<BR>Visual C# .NET<BR><BR><BR>Visual C# 
      (pronounced C sharp) is designed to be a fast and easy way to create .NET 
      applications, including Web services and ASP.NET Web applications. 
      Applications written in Visual C# are built on the services of the common 
      language runtime and take full advantage of the .NET Framework. <BR><BR>C# 
      is a simple, elegant, type-safe, object-oriented language recently 
      developed by Microsoft for building a wide range of applications. Anyone 
      familiar with C and similar languages will find few problems in adapting 
      to C#. C# is designed to bring rapid development to the C++ programmer 
      without sacrificing the power and control that are a hallmark of C and 
      C++. Because of this heritage, C# has a high degree of fidelity with C and 
      C++, and developers familiar with these languages can quickly become 
      productive in C#. C# provides intrinsic code trust mechanisms for a high 
      level of security, garbage collection, and type safety. C# supports single 
      inheritance and creates Microsoft intermediate language (MSIL) as input to 
      native code compilers. <BR><BR>C# is fully integrated with the .NET 
      Framework and the common language runtime, which together provide language 
      interoperability, garbage collection, enhanced security, and improved 
      versioning support. C# simplifies and modernizes some of the more complex 
      aspects of C and C++, notably namespaces, classes, enumerations, 
      overloading, and structured exception handling. C# also eliminates C and 
      C++ features such as macros, multiple inheritance, and virtual base 
      classes. For current C++ developers, C# provides a powerful, 
      high-productivity language alternative. <BR><BR>Visual C# provides 
      prototypes of some common project types, including:<BR>• Windows 
      Application.<BR>• Class Library.<BR>• Windows Control Library.<BR>• 
      ASP.NET Web Application.<BR>• ASP.NET Web Service.<BR>• Web Control 
      Library.<BR>• Console Application.<BR>• Windows Service.</SPAN></P><SPAN
