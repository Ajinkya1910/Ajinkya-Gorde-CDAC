      <P><B><SPAN class=for_questions_blue>What are Attributes?</SPAN><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR></SPAN></B><SPAN class=answers>Attributes are 
      declarative tags in code that insert additional metadata into an assembly. 
      There exist two types of attributes in the .NET Framework: Predefined 
      attributes such as AssemblyVersion, which already exist and are accessed 
      through the Runtime Classes; and custom attributes, which you write 
      yourself by extending the System.Attribute class. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>What are the Types of Assemblies? </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>Assemblies are of two types:<BR>1. Private 
      Assemblies<BR>2. Shared Assemblies<BR>Private Assemblies: The assembly is 
      intended only for one application. The files of that assembly must be 
      placed in the same folder as the application or in a sub folder. No other 
      application will be able to make a call to this assembly. The advantage of 
      having a private assembly is that, it makes naming the assembly very easy, 
      since the developer need not worry about name clashes with other 
      assemblies. As long as the assembly has a unique name within the concerned 
      application, there won't be any problems.<BR>Shared Assemblies: If the 
      assembly is to be made into a Shared Assembly, then the naming conventions 
      are very strict since it has to be unique across the entire system. The 
      naming conventions should also take care of newer versions of the 
      component being shipped. These are accomplished by giving the assembly a 
      Shared Name. Then the assembly is placed in the global assembly cache, 
      which is a folder in the file system reserved for shared assemblies. 
      </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>What is an Intermediate language? </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>Assemblies are made up of IL code modules and the 
      metadata that describes them. Although programs may be compiled via an IDE 
      or the command line, in fact, they are simply translated into IL, not 
      machine code. The actual machine code is not generated until the function 
      that requires it is called. This is the just-in-time, or JIT, compilation 
      feature of .NET. JIT compilation happens at runtime for a variety of 
      reasons, one of the most ambitious being Microsoft's desire for 
      cross-platform .NET adoption. If a CLR is built for another operating 
      system (UNIX or Mac), the same assemblies will run in addition to the 
      Microsoft platforms. The hope is that .NET assemblies are 
      write-once-run-anywhere applications. This is a .NET feature that works 
      behind-the-scenes, ensuring that developers are not limited to writing 
      applications for one single line of products. No one has demonstrated 
      whether or not this promise will ever truly materialize. <BR><BR>CTS/CLS 
      <BR><BR>The MSIL Instruction Set Specification is included with the .NET 
      SDK, along with the IL Assembly Language Programmers Reference. If a 
      developer wants to write custom .NET programming languages, these are the 
      necessary specifications and syntax. The CTS and CLS define the types and 
      syntaxes that every .NET language needs to embrace. An application may not 
      expose these features, but it must consider them when communicating 
      through IL.</SPAN></P>
      <P><SPAN class=answers>ASP.NET Authentication Providers and IIS Security 
      <BR><BR>ASP.NET implements authentication using authentication providers, 
      which are code modules that verify credentials and implement other 
      security functionality such as cookie generation. ASP.NET supports the 
      following three authentication providers: <BR><BR>Forms Authentication: 
      Using this provider causes unauthenticated requests to be redirected to a 
      specified HTML form using client side redirection. The user can then 
      supply logon credentials, and post the form back to the server. If the 
      application authenticates the request (using application-specific logic), 
      ASP.NET issues a cookie that contains the credentials or a key for 
      reacquiring the client identity. Subsequent requests are issued with the 
      cookie in the request headers, which means that subsequent authentications 
      are unnecessary. <BR><BR>Passport Authentication: This is a centralized 
      authentication service provided by Microsoft that offers a single logon 
      facility and membership services for participating sites. ASP.NET, in 
      conjunction with the Microsoft® Passport software development kit (SDK), 
      provides similar functionality as Forms Authentication to Passport users. 
      <BR><BR>Windows Authentication: This provider utilizes the authentication 
      capabilities of IIS. After IIS completes its authentication, ASP.NET uses 
      the authenticated identity's token to authorize access. <BR><BR>To enable 
      a specified authentication provider for an ASP.NET application, you must 
      create an entry in the application's configuration file as follows:<BR>// 
      web.config file </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>What is the difference between ASP and 
      ASP.NET? </B><SPAN class=answers><BR>ASP is interpreted. ASP.NET Compiled 
      event base programming.<BR>Control events for text button can be handled 
      at client javascript only. Since we have server controls events can handle 
      at server side.<BR>More error handling. <BR><BR>ASP .NET has better 
      language support, a large set of new controls and XML based components, 
      and better user authentication. <BR><BR>ASP .NET provides increased 
      performance by running compiled code. <BR><BR>ASP .NET code is not fully 
      backward compatible with ASP. <BR><BR>ASP .NET also contains a new set of 
      object oriented input controls, like programmable list boxes, validation 
      controls. A new data grid control supports sorting, data paging, and 
      everything you expect from a dataset control. The first request for an 
      ASP.NET page on the server will compile the ASP .NET code and keep a 
      cached copy in memory. The result of this is greatly increased 
      performance. <BR><BR>ASP .NET is not fully compatible with earlier 
      versions of ASP, so most of the old ASP code will need some changes to run 
      under ASP .NET. To overcome this problem, <BR><BR>ASP .NET uses a new file 
      extension ".aspx". This will make ASP .NET applications able to run side 
      by side with standard ASP applications on the same server.</SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>Using COM Component in .Net ?</B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>As most of you know that .Net does not encourage the 
      development of COM components and provides a different solution to making 
      reusable components through Assemblies. But, there are a lot of COM 
      components present which our .Net application might need to use. 
      Fortunately, .Net provides an extremely simple approach to achieve this. 
      This is achieved by using ‘Wrapper Classes’ and ‘Proxy Components’. .Net 
      wraps the COM component into .Net assembly technically called ‘Runtime 
      Callable Wrapper’ or RCW. Then u can call and use your COM component just 
      as a .Net (or C#, if u are using C#) Assembly. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>What is an assembly? </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>An assembly is the primary building block of a .NET 
      Framework application. It is a collection of functionality that is built, 
      versioned, and deployed as a single implementation unit (as one or more 
      files). All managed types and resources are marked either as accessible 
      only within their implementation unit, or as accessible by code outside 
      that unit. .NET Assembly contains all the metadata about the modules, 
      types, and other elements it contains in the form of a manifest. The CLR 
      loves assemblies because differing programming languages are just perfect 
      for creating certain kinds of applications. For example, COBOL stands for 
      Common Business-Oriented Language because it’s tailor-made for creating 
      business apps. However, it’s not much good for creating drafting programs. 
      Regardless of what language you used to create your modules, they can all 
      work together within one Portable Executable Assembly. There’s a hierarchy 
      to the structure of .NET code. That hierarchy is Assembly - &gt; Module 
      -&gt; Type -&gt; Method." Assemblies can be static or dynamic. Static 
      assemblies can include .NET Framework types (interfaces and classes), as 
      well as resources for the assembly (bitmaps, JPEG files, resource files, 
      and so on). Static assemblies are stored on disk in portable executable 
      (PE) files. You can also use the .NET Framework to create dynamic 
      assemblies, which are run directly from memory and are not saved to disk 
      before execution. You can save dynamic assemblies to disk after they have 
      executed. </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>What is a Web Service? </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>A web service is a software component that exposes 
      itself through the open communication channels of the Internet. 
      Applications running on remote machines, on potentially different 
      platforms, can access these components in a language and 
      platform-independent manner. A Web Service is a group of functions, 
      packaged together for use in a common framework throughout a network. 
      </SPAN></P>
      <P><B class=for_questions_blue>webFarm Vs webGardens </B><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR>A web farm is a multi-server scenario. So we may have a 
      server in each state of US. If the load on one server is in excess then 
      the other servers step in to bear the brunt.<BR>How they bear it is based 
      on various models.<BR>1. RoundRobin. (All servers share load 
      equally)<BR>2. NLB (economical)<BR>3. HLB (expensive but can scale up to 
      8192 servers)<BR>4. Hybrid (of 2 and 3).<BR>5. CLB (Component load 
      balancer).<BR>A web garden is a multi-processor setup. i.e., a single 
      server (not like the multi server above).<BR>How to implement webfarms in 
      .Net:<BR>Go to web.config and Here for mode = you have 4 options.<BR>a) 
      Say mode=inproc (non web farm but fast when you have very few 
      customers).<BR>b) Say mode=StateServer (for webfarm)<BR>c) Say 
      mode=SqlServer (for webfarm)<BR>Whether to use option b or c depends on 
      situation. StateServer is faster but SqlServer is more reliable and used 
      for mission critical applications.<BR>How to use webgardens in .Net:<BR>Go 
      to web.config and Change the false to true. You have one more attribute 
      that is related to webgarden in the same tag called 
      cpuMask.</SPAN></P><SPAN class=bottom_links><SPAN class=answers>Page
