	 * If you take a look at Hibernate flush order, you’ll see that the persist action is executed 
	 * before the collection elements are handled. This way,
	 *  Hibernate inserts the child records first without the Foreign Key since the child entity
	 *   does not store this information. 
	 *  During collection handling phase, the Foreign Key column is updated accordingly.
