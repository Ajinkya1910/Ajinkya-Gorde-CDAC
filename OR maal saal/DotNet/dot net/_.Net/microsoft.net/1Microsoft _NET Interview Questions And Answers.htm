      <P class=answers><B><SPAN class=for_questions_blue>What are the advantages 
      and drawbacks of using ADO.NET?</SPAN><SPAN 
      class=answers><BR></SPAN></B>Pros<BR>====<BR>ADO.NET is rich with plenty 
      of features that are bound to impress even the most skeptical of 
      programmers. If this weren’t the case, Microsoft wouldn’t even be able to 
      get anyone to use the Beta. What we’ve done here is come up with a short 
      list of some of the more outstanding benefits to using the ADO.NET 
      architecture and the System.Data namespace. <BR><BR>* Performance – there 
      is no doubt that ADO.NET is extremely fast. The actual figures vary 
      depending on who performed the test and which benchmark was being used, 
      but ADO.NET performs much, much faster at the same tasks than its 
      predecessor, ADO. Some of the reasons why ADO.NET is faster than ADO are 
      discussed in the ADO versus ADO.NET section later in this chapter. 
      <BR><BR>* Optimized SQL Provider – in addition to performing well under 
      general circumstances, ADO.NET includes a SQL Server Data Provider that is 
      highly optimized for interaction with SQL Server. It uses SQL Server’s own 
      TDS (Tabular Data Stream) format for exchanging information. Without 
      question, your SQL Server 7 and above data access operations will run 
      blazingly fast utilizing this optimized Data Provider. <BR><BR>* XML 
      Support (and Reliance) – everything you do in ADO.NET at some point will 
      boil down to the use of XML. In fact, many of the classes in ADO.NET, such 
      as the DataSet, are so intertwined with XML that they simply cannot exist 
      or function without utilizing the technology. You’ll see later when we 
      compare and contrast the “old” and the “new” why the reliance on XML for 
      internal storage provides many, many advantages, both to the framework and 
      to the programmer utilizing the class library. <BR><BR>* Disconnected 
      Operation Model – the core ADO.NET class, the DataSet, operates in an 
      entirely disconnected fashion. This may be new to some programmers, but it 
      is a remarkably efficient and scalable architecture. Because the 
      disconnected model allows for the DataSet class to be unaware of the 
      origin of its data, an unlimited number of supported data sources can be 
      plugged into code without any hassle in the future. <BR><BR>* Rich Object 
      Model – the entire ADO.NET architecture is built on a hierarchy of class 
      inheritance and interface implementation. Once you start looking for 
      things you need within this namespace, you’ll find that the logical 
      inheritance of features and base class support makes the entire system 
      extremely easy to use, and very customizable to suit your own needs. It is 
      just another example of how everything in the .NET framework is pushing 
      toward a trend of strong application design and strong OOP 
      implementations. <BR><BR>Cons<BR>====<BR>Hard as it may be to believe, 
      there are a couple of drawbacks or disadvantages to using the ADO.NET 
      architecture. I’m sure others can find many more faults than we list here, 
      but we decided to stick with a short list of some of the more obvious and 
      important shortcomings of the technology. <BR><BR>* Managed-Only Access – 
      for a few obvious reasons, and some far more technical, you cannot utilize 
      the ADO.NET architecture from anything but managed code. This means that 
      there is no COM interoperability allowed for ADO.NET. Therefore, in order 
      to take advantage of the advanced SQL Server Data Provider and any other 
      feature like DataSets, XML internal data storage, etc, your code must be 
      running under the CLR. <BR><BR>* Only Three Managed Data Providers (so 
      far) – unfortunately, if you need to access any data that requires a 
      driver that cannot be used through either an OLEDB provider or the SQL 
      Server Data Provider, then you may be out of luck. However, the good news 
      is that the OLEDB provider for ODBC is available for download from 
      Microsoft. At that point the down-side becomes one of performance, in 
      which you are invoking multiple layers of abstraction as well as crossing 
      the COM InterOp gap, incurring some initial overhead as well. <BR><BR>* 
      Learning Curve – despite the misleading name, ADO.NET is not simply a new 
      version of ADO, nor should it even be considered a direct successor. 
      ADO.NET should be thought of more as the data access class library for use 
      with the .NET framework. The difficulty in learning to use ADO.NET to its 
      fullest is that a lot of it does seem familiar. It is this that causes 
      some common pitfalls. Programmers need to learn that even though some 
      syntax may appear the same, there is actually a considerable amount of 
      difference in the internal workings of many classes. For example (this 
      will be discussed in far more detail later), an ADO.NET DataSet is nothing 
      at all like a disconnected ADO RecordSet. Some may consider a learning 
      curve a drawback, but I consider learning curves more like scheduling 
      issues. There’s a learning curve in learning anything new; it’s just up to 
      you to schedule that curve into your time so that you can learn the new 
      technology at a pace that fits your schedule. </P>

      <P class=answers><B class=for_questions_blue>What is the use of 
      ErrorProvider Control? </B><BR>The ErrorProvider control is used to 
      indicate invalid data on a data entry form. Using this control, you can 
      attach error messages that display next to the control when the data is 
      invalid, as seen in the following image. A red circle with an exclamation 
      point blinks, and when the user mouses over the icon, the error message is 
      displayed as a tooltip.</P>
      <P class=answers><B class=for_questions_blue>What is CLR? </B><BR>Answer 
      1:<BR>CLR(Common Language Runtime) is the main resource of .Net Framework. 
      it is collection of services like garbage collector, exception handler, 
      jit compilers etc. with the CLR cross language integration is possible. 
      <BR><BR>Answer 2:<BR>The .NET Framework provides a runtime environment 
      which runs the code and provides services that make the development 
      process easier. This runtime environment in .NET Framework is known as 
      Common Language Runtime (CLR). The CLR sits at the very heart of managed 
      code. Common Language Runtime is the generalized multi-language, 
      reflective execution engine on which code originally written in various 
      languages runs. At a higher level, CLR is simply an engine that takes in 
      Intermediate Language (IL) instructions, translates them into machine 
      instructions, and executes them. Although the common language runtime 
      provides many standard runtime services, managed code is never 
      interpreted. A feature called just-in-time (JIT) compiling enables all 
      managed code to run in the native machine language of the system on which 
      it is executing. The CLR shares much in common with a traditional 
      operating system. <BR><BR>Quote:<BR>Managed code is the term used for any 
      code that is running on .NET Framework. <BR><BR>The CLR provides the 
      infrastructure that enables managed code to execute as well provides 
      variety of services during execution. When a method, for which IL has been 
      generated, is called for the first time the CLR compiles the IL into 
      native code that is specific to the processor the Environment it is 
      running on (This process is known as Just in Time Compilation or JIT). If 
      the same method is called next time, the existing JIT compiled code is 
      reused. During execution managed code receives variety of services from 
      the runtime environment. <BR><BR>Quote:<BR>When compiling to managed code, 
      the compiler translates your source code into Microsoft intermediate 
      language (MSIL), which is a CPU-independent set of instructions that can 
      be efficiently converted to native code. Intermediate Language is a binary 
      assembly language that is compiled at runtime down to whatever machine 
      language is appropriate for the host CPU. This runtime compilation is 
      called Just-In-Time Compiling or JIT-compiling. <BR><BR>Advantages of 
      Managed Execution Environments <BR>In unmanaged environments the compiler 
      and linker directly compile the source code in to native instructions that 
      are targeted at a specific processor. The disadvantage of this process is 
      that each time you want to run your executable on a different platform you 
      will have to re-compile the code using a compiler and linker that will 
      compile the code that is targeted at the specific hardware. This means 
      that each time you want your application to run on a different platform, 
      you will have to ship the compiled instructions again and again. As this 
      leads to compiling and maintaining multiple versions of the same 
      application, the companies try to create a more generalized compiled 
      version in order to target most of the environments. This process is known 
      as the Lowest Common Denominator approach. This leads to a more 
      generalized program which is not optimized properly and does not take 
      advantages of the underlying hardware infrastructure (processor, cache, 
      etc). Because the CLR supplies one or more Just in Time Compiler for each 
      computer architecture it supports, the same set of MSIL can be 
      JIT-compiled and run on any supported architecture. This <BR><BR>CLR 
      provides the following benefits for developers: <BR>Vastly simplified 
      development.<BR>Seamless integration of code written in various 
      languages.<BR>Evidence-based security with code 
      identity.<BR>Assembly-based deployment that eliminates DLL 
      Hell.<BR>Side-by-side versioning of reusable components.<BR>Code reuse 
      through implementation inheritance.<BR>Automatic object lifetime 
      management.<BR>Code access security.<BR>Cross Language 
      Integration.<BR>Self describing objects.<BR><BR>The CLR automatically 
      handles object layout and manages references to objects, releasing them 
      when they are no longer being used. This automatic memory management 
      resolves the two most common application errors, memory leaks and invalid 
      memory references. This process is known as Garbage Collection. The CLR 
      also manages thread execution, code execution, code safety verification, 
      compilation, and other system services. <BR><BR>The CLR is designed for 
      the software of the future, and it also supports software of today and 
      yesterday. Interoperability between managed and unmanaged code provided by 
      CLR helps developers continue to use necessary COM components and DLLs. 
      </P>
      <P class=answers><B class=for_questions_blue>What is Delegate and what is 
      it used for ? </B><BR>Delegate is kinda like a pointer to a function in 
      C++ or like an event handler in Java <BR>You can use it to “multicast” 
      which means running multiple functions in different instances of object 
      already created. <BR>This is useful when you want your objects to 
      “register” to an event raised by another object. <BR>The way it works is 
      the object you are registered to listen to recieves the delegate of the 
      function it is supposed to run in your object, the delegate is then run 
      from it. (if you switch the word delegate for pointer, this would be much 
      simpler) </P>
      <P class=answers><B class=for_questions_blue>How is meant by DLL ? 
      </B><BR>A DLL (Dynamic Link Library) is a file that can be loaded and 
      executed by programs dynamically. Basically it’s an external code 
      repository for programs. Since usually several different programs reuse 
      the same DLL instead of having that code in their own file, this 
      dramatically reduces required storage space. A synonym for a DLL would be 
      library. </P>
      <P class=answers><B class=for_questions_blue>Which DLL translate XML to 
      SQL in IIS? </B><BR>Sqlisapi.dll </P>
      <P class=answers><B class=for_questions_blue>Can anyone tell me about 
      Secure Socket Layer? How to make use of the technology? </B><BR>Secure 
      Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), its successor, are 
      cryptographic protocols which provide secure communications on the 
      Internet. There are slight differences between SSL 3.0 and TLS 1.0, but 
      the protocol remains substantially the same. The term “SSL” as used here 
      applies to both protocols unless clarified by context.</P><SPAN
