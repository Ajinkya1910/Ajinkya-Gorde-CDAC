Interface in Java

What is interface ?

An interface in java is a blueprint of a class. It has public static final data members  and public n abstract methods only.

The interface in java is a mechanism to achieve fully abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the java interface not method body(true till JDK 1.7) . It is used to achieve full abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.

Java Interface also represents IS-A relationship.

It cannot be instantiated just like abstract class.

Why java interfaces?

1. It is used to achieve full abstraction.
2. By interface, we can support the functionality of multiple inheritance.
3. It can be used to achieve loose coupling.
(Interfaces allow complete separation between WHAT(specification or a contract) is to be done Vs HOW (implementation details) it's to be done

eg : In JDBC (java db connectivity)
java.sql.Connection i/f ----Sun
Imple. classes -- DB vendors -- 
Oracle --Oracle DB engine --Imple cls for Comnection i/f
Red Hat -- Mysql -- Implementation cls for Connection i/f


The java compiler adds public and abstract keywords before the interface method and public, static and final keywords before data members.
---------------------------
syntax of interface

default(no modifier)/public interface Name extends comma separated list of super i/fs
{
   //data members --- public static final
   int data=100;
   //methods -- public abstract
   double calc(double d1,double d2);

}
Implementing class syntax
default(no modifier)/public class Name extends SuperCls implements comma separated list of  i/fs {
   //Mandatory for imple class to be non-abstract(concrete): MUST define/imple all abstract methods from all i/fs.
   
}

 
1. Relationship between classes and interfaces

A class extends another class, an interface extends another interface but a class implements an interface.

2. Multiple inheritance in Java by interface

If a class implements multiple interfaces, or an interface extends multiple interfaces i.e. known as multiple inheritance.
eg : 

Multiple inheritance in java
interface Printable{  
void print();  
}  
  
interface Showable{  
void show();  
}  
  
class A implements Printable,Showable{  
  
public void print(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
public void show(){System.out.println("Welcome");}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
A obj = new A();  
obj.print();  
obj.show();  
 }  
}  

Question 

Multiple inheritance is not supported through class in java but it is possible by interface, why?

Multiple inheritance is not supported in case of class, sincee it can create an ambiguity. But it is supported in case of interface because there is no ambiguity as implementation is provided by the implementation class.

 For example:
interface Printable{  
void print();  
}  
interface Showable{  
void print();  
}  
  
class TestTnterface1 implements Printable,Showable{  
public void print(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
public static void main(String args[]){  
TestTnterface1 obj = new TestTnterface1();  
obj.print();  
 }  
}  

As you can see in the above example, Printable and Showable interface have same methods but its implementation is provided by class TestTnterface1, so there is no ambiguity.


Interface inheritance

A class implements interface but one interface extends another interface .

interface Printable{  
void print();  
}  
interface Showable extends Printable{  
void show();  
}  
class Testinterface2 implements Showable{  
  
public void print(){System.out.println("Hello");}  
public void show(){System.out.println("Welcome");}  
  
public static void main(String args[]){  
Testinterface2 obj = new Testinterface2();  
obj.print();  
obj.show();  
 }  
}  


Q) What is marker or tagged interface?

An interface that have no member is known as marker or tagged interface. For example: Serializable, Cloneable, Remote etc. They are used to provide some essential information to the JVM(Run time marker)  so that JVM may perform some useful operation.

//How Serializable interface is written?  
public interface Serializable{  
}  

Nested Interface in Java

Note: An interface can have another interface i.e. known as nested interface. 

eg :
interface printable{  
 void print();  
 interface MessagePrintable{  
   void msg();  
 }  
}
